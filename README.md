# 🧠 Malaria Detection Using CNN & Streamlit

This project is a deep learning-based web app built with **TensorFlow** and **Streamlit** to detect whether a person is infected with **Malaria** from a cell image.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** trained on the **Malaria dataset** to classify cell images as:
- ✅ **Parasitized (Malaria Positive)**
- ❌ **Uninfected (Malaria Negative)**

The Streamlit app provides an **easy-to-use interface** where users can upload an image, and the trained model predicts the infection status instantly.

## 🧩 Tech Stack
- **Python 3.x**
- **TensorFlow / Keras**
- **Streamlit**
- **NumPy**
- **Pillow**
- **Matplotlib**
- **TensorFlow Datasets**

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/selfskill-dev/malaria-detection-cnn.git
cd malaria-detection-cnn

🧪 Model Performance

Model: CNN (4 Conv2D layers)

Accuracy: ~98%

Optimizer: Adam

Loss Function: Binary Crossentropy

💻 Usage

Run the app.

Upload a cell image (.jpg or .png).

Wait for the prediction.

The app will show whether the sample is infected or not.
